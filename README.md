# Look up

www.lookup.surge.sh

Look Up provides information on interesting spatial phenomena, including, but not limited to, sightings/data regarding unidentified flying objects. My data is curated and displayed in such a way, that a user does not need to parse through misinformation, but can instead focus on the facts and only the leading, most reputable sources for such sensitive information.

My project solves this by providing multiple data access points from a variety of sources.

The API(s) my project uses are: TheySaidSO(a quotes database API), Nasa’s APOD api, and Quandl/NUFORC’s UFO sightings API. I also use embeds from Twitter and Soundcloud.
