My project provides information on interesting spatial phenomena, including, but not limited to, sightings/data regarding unidentified flying objects. My data is curated and displayed in such a way, that a user does not need to parse through unending useless fallacies, hoaxes and the like, but can instead focus on the facts and only the leading, most reputable sources for such sensitive information.
Serious space enthusiasts often have this problem, as they are inundated with people who just want something to believe in and don’t care whether their data is measurable or sourced from trustable places.
My project solves this by providing multiple data access points from a variety of sources that I have hand-picked. My project signals to the customer what sort of data they will be looking at through the design elements of my page, as well as the source of the content curated.
The inputs my project requires are strings, JSON objects (APIs), input field strings, as well as embedded urls/videos/sound.
The outputs of my project are rendered objects primarily.
The API(s) my project uses are: TheySaidSO(a quotes database API), Nasa’s APOD api, and Quandl/NUFORC’s UFO sightings API. I also use embeds from Twitter and Soundcloud.

7.   My MVP goals are to:
	1. have my APOD api producing optimized images in a carousel/scroll with potentially 6-30 	images total(depending on whether I choose a week or month view), as well as an input search field for users to request specific pictures from specific days, weeks, and/or 	months.
	2. Have my quotes API producing random Car Sagan quotes upon each refresh 		displayed properly in a medium sized card centered under the photo(s)
	3. Have a resources link from my footer that lists all APIs used as well as links to the 	most advanced simulations provided primarily by NASA as well as other Institutes. This 	page will also house links to Nasa’s Kepler Twitter feed, inspiring images, a database stored on Soundcloud of interesting sounds recorded from space (via NASA) (If I don’t get my Space sounds API up and running) and other interesting websites.
